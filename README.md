# Bank-customer-clustering using K-Modes 
#### This repository contains a sample implementation of K-Modes clustering.
* K-Modes clustering is one of the unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms that is used to cluster categorical variables.
#### So why KModes when we already have KMeans?
1. KMeans uses mathematical measures (distance) to cluster continuous data. The lesser the distance, the more similar our data points are. 
2. Centroids are updated by Means.
3. But for categorical data points, we cannot calculate the distance. So we go for KModes algorithm. 
4. It uses the dissimilarities(total mismatches) between the data points. The lesser the dissimilarities the more similar our data points are. 
5. It uses Modes instead of means.
